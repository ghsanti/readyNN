# readyNN
Links to good Neural Networks that are ready to use, with pretrained weights, descriptions and license info. 

It is mostly set for people looking for models that will need to be ported to Javascript, to be used in the web or elsewhere.

**Object Detection**
* [Yolov7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7), GPLv3, with smaller NN useful for phones, and also larger ones.  
* [YoloX](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX), Apache2.0. Great project.  

**Many Models**
* Pytorch models + weights, license to check per model. [See here for Vision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html)
* [Tf models and weights](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications), license to check per model

**Hubs**
* [Pytorch Hub,](https://pytorch.org/hub/)  license to check per model
* Tf Hub (less useful, many frozen models), license to check per model. [See here](https://tfhub.dev/)
