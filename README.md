# readyNN
Links to good Neural Networks that are ready to use, with pretrained weights, descriptions and license info. 

**Object Detection**
* [Yolov7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7), GPLv3, with smaller NN useful for phones, and also larger ones.  

**Many Models**
* Pytorch models + weights, license to check per model. [See here for Vision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html)
* [Tf models and weights](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications), license to check per model

**Hubs**
* [Pytorch Hub,](https://pytorch.org/hub/)  license to check per model
* Tf Hub (less useful, many frozen models), license to check per model. [See here](https://tfhub.dev/)
